# Birdoids
Asteroids-styled game with a boid twist, in gameplay mostly an avian exterminator.

Conceptualized and created in 4 days. Code cleanup done after a 2 day break, reducing crashes and (hopefully) improving code.
It's not the prettiest, but I liked experimenting with the flocking behaviour.
The gameplay was surprisingly the easiest to implement, most of my time was spent tweaking the flocking behaviour,
and extending it to avoid obstacles well and such.
Performance improvements were necessary to get it to run decent at higher boid count,
and I had to extend raymath.h a bit regarding Vector2 for better performance and easier code writing.
